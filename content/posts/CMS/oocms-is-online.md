Finally, I have the time and the will to upload my OOCMS work to this host! This will ensure easy maintenance and development, while making sure that I wont have to transfer all of the content from one database to another every time I change a version.

Why, because using this OOCMS gives standardization so the database structure will work across versions. To make it short, this iteration is future-proof.

As you can see, I haven't transfer all of the content from my old blog to here, but I will when I have the time. Finally, after some hardwork, I have moved all of the content to this new platform. The comments are not there though, because of the new platform.

If you're interested in my OOCMS work, please go to [https://github.com/yohanesmario/oocms](https://github.com/yohanesmario/oocms).

Happy blogging!
