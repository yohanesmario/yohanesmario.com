After reading [Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig](https://www.amazon.com/Reasons-Stay-Alive-Matt-Haig/dp/0143128728), I was inspired to write a poem of sort.

I call it "Galaxy".

> See beyond the sky \
> There are galaxies vast and wide \
> The stars are beautiful \
> You hardly see the dark \
> \
> Now, look inside your mind \
> It's dark and cold \
> But if you look hard enough \
> There are lights waiting for you \
> \
> Your mind is a galaxy \
> There are more darkness than lights \
> But try to really see \
> Without the dark you can't appreciate the light \
> \
> Memories of grandma laughing in her last moments \
> As your grandpa feeds her the birthday cake \
> When you joined your first company \
> When she said yes to the cheap ring you can barely afford \
> \
> These are stars in your galaxy \
> Circling the black hole at your heart \
> Now it's your turn \
> To be a star in someone else'
