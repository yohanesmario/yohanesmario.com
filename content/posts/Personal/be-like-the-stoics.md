I'm currently so hyped up about stoicism, so why not post my thoughts here?

Stoicism is usually summed up into these 4 virtues:

1. Wisdom &mdash; *seeing things for what they are, not what we wish they would be*
2. Courage &mdash; *acting in the right way despite fear or reservation*
3. Justice &mdash; *acting fairly despite pressure not to*
4. Temperance &mdash; *acting with discipline and self control despite the draws of passion and greed*

I have grasped their concept of wisdom, but still working on courage, justice, and temperance. Their teachings are so simple, but require a strong resolve to master.

It's a way of living life amids chaos, being composed while facing adversities.

My reference to this is so far from this book:
