> Money? Growth? Recognition? Appreciation?

> Or is it all of the above?

This question bugs me lately. Why do I work? If money is not required for living, will I still be on the same job that I'm doing right now? Does my personal growth always have to be in line with my career growth? What is it that I seek out of my employment?

In trying to answer that, I came up with several list of things that I actually benefited from having a job.


##### Feeling Needed

This is the one benefit that I notice the most out of my job. I need to feel needed. I think, to some extent, everyone does. That's why I think I can never be in a job that doesn't provide me with this feeling.

##### Sense of Improvement in Life

I think, without this, life will feel flat. Like stale water, it will get ugly fast, and swarming with bacteria.

##### Being Appreciated for What I Do

This is not quite obvious but I do feel the need to have this out of my job, or everything else for that matter, or I will lose motivation fast. Not blind appreciation though, credit where credit's due.

##### Keeping My Mind Busy

This is quite important especially for me. My mind is a mess when I'm not actively trying to tame it. Working on a job that requires higher order thinking help keeps me sane.

##### Sadly, Also Money

The sad fact of life is that we need money to live. So yes, my job is helping me in removing another unnecessary stressor.

##### Finally, Doing Something That I Actually Love

This is quite obvious if you know me at all. I LOVE my job, not my current job per se, but what I do as a Software Engineer overall. I was hesitant to turn my hobby into my career, and glad that I did it.

So the answer to the question "Why Do We Need to Work?" is not that simple for me, because I have mashed my needs, my hobby, and my life into this career. I don't know if it will be a good thing in the long run, but so far this seems to work fine. :upside_down_face:
