I've just got my first spam comment. That's not a big problem for me, since I disabled HTML tags in my comment system, so they can't post any real link in this post, nor a malicious javascript. It will be a problem in the long run though since I'm planning to add email notification to the comment system.

That's why I immediately add captcha to the comment system. Captcha is a sequence of text which is printed on an image to make sure that only human can read and interpret it.

To understand how to make it, please visit [this site](http://www.myphptutorials.com/tutorials/21/membuat-captcha-dengan-php) (Indonesian). If you're looking for an english alternative, you can google it. Just type "captcha php".

Let's fight spammers to assure our readers that they are talking to a human, not something else!  
Happy blogging!
