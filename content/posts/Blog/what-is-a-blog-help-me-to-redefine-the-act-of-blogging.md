Lately, I'm preparing some great features to be released in the alpha2 version of this blog. However, I've been thinking lately, what a blog is really? Is it another kind of website which has a bunch of great features with no purpose whatsoever? Or is it a really personal website which only logged our frequent updates and still have no meaning for anyone other than ourselves?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), the definition of a blog is:

> A blog is a type of website or part of a website. Blogs are usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Entries are commonly displayed in reverse-chronological order.

In short, it is a website piled with posts, comments, multimedia files, etc, and still have no single exact purpose.

I'm thinking, blogs doesn't have any definite purpose. Then, I suddenly realize, blogs doesn't have any definite purpose. Each blog is unique, they have to. Blogs needs to accommodate their owner to express themselves through their blog. It's not a place to earn money, nor to earn popularity. It's a place to be yourself. It have to be.

For example, an artist's blog will have to be able to allow the artist to paint on the wall of the blog. A photographer's blog will have to be able to organize and edit his/her photos into a beautiful photo stack. A musician's blog will have to be able to allow the musician to play any of his/her favorite instruments and record it into a beautiful orchestra. In other word, it needs to be able to do anything the owner want to do.

It's just a short glimpse of idea which I've just got recently, so it's still raw. That's why I'm inviting you to contribute to redefine the act of blogging. Just answer in the comment, "What is a blog for you?", and I will try to find a way to implement all of your suggestion, with attribution of course.

I'll be waiting for your contribution! Happy blogging!
