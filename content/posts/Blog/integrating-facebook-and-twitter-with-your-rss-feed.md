Several weeks ago, I have a very raw idea of feeding my twitter and facebook account with my blog posts automatically. That includes making a specific facebook and twitter app, which is a deal-breaker for me, because that will be a very hard thing to do.

Luckily, someone from [Greenpeace Indonesia](http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/id/) emailed me today to ask me if I could help to make a social network integration system for their petitions. That remind me of my idea about social network integration. It suddenly occurs to me that it's not that hard. In fact, it's very easy. Even a non technical blogger can implement the system without getting any headache.

Thanks to the awesome developer of social networking integration systems, we now have many system to help us with this specific needs. I found several great system, among them are [HootSuite](https://hootsuite.com/) and [TwitterFeed](http://twitterfeed.com/)

Implementing their system is as simple as registering your social networks, and then you can add a feed and customize the settings for posting your feed to your social networks. I'm currently using [HootSuite](https://hootsuite.com/). I haven't tested [TwitterFeed](http://twitterfeed.com/) yet, but I'm sure they are pretty much the same.

That's all from me. I'm preparing an Alpha2 version of this blog with some pretty big changes, so, stay tuned and happy blogging!
