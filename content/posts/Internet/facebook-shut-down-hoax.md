I've just recently heard the news that Facebook will be closed by 15 March 2011. I know it's late, because I don't really follow this kind of news. Once I know this (from my mom who claimed that she get the news from kompas.com) I immediately check for the news on the internet. Well, it seems that most major news sources in Indonesia actually act like it's a truth, except TempoInteraktif.

The funny thing is , by today, people in MediaIndonesia still believe that Facebook is really being closed. I read all the comments, and that's just insane!

Guys, I can confirm that this news is 100% HOAX. You can check [the web](http://weeklyworldnews.com/) where this news comes from. See for yourself what kind of website that is.
