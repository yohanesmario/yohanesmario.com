Finally, I can create a safe admin page with login prompt!

Currently, it is just able to post new content and update previous content. Well, you don not need to know anything about that since you wont be using it, but it is safe to say that it will be a lot easier for me to update this blog without having to login to my hosting account.

As a bonus, I added a better comment system so that people can distinguish between an admin and a visitor. The admin (me) will have a red line on the left side of his comment.

Well, it is already 2:22 AM here (my server time is 2 minutes behind my laptop clock), so I can not think much of what to post about. So, that is all from me.  
Happy blogging!
