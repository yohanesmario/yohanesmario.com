A 3D graphics in a web browser has been many people's dream. Imagine what we can build using this technology. People no longer have to download client application to play 3D online game, or we can even make a 3D UI for our website. This technology exist. It's called "WebGL".

Currently, I'm still in the process of studying this thing, so I don't have much to share. All I know so far is that this stuff is not very much different from OpenGL, so people who have studied and understood OpenGL should be able to understand WebGL with virtually no problem at all.

With that being said, The progress of this CMS' development will be on halt for a while, because I need to study WebGL for future developments of this CMS. If you want to study WebGL, you can learn from the lessons provided [here](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217).

Hopefully, I'll understand this quickly, and then I can continue developing this CMS. I'll post something if I find interesting things during my study.  
Thanks for reading and happy blogging!
