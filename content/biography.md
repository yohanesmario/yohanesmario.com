My name is Yohanes Mario Chandra and I currently stay in Serpong, Indonesia. I studied Informatics at [Parahyangan Catholic University](https://unpar.ac.id). I currently worked at [AgriAku](https://agriaku.com) as a Lead Backend Engineer.

My life in software engineering is interesting, as it introduces me to a lot of interesting and new paradigms I've never heard before in my studies. I'm still learning from many great mentors, and I hope I always will.

You can contact me via [email or social media](/contact) if you need anything.
